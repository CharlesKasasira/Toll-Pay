## Problem Statement
---

Today Saving and Credit cooperatives (**SACCOs**) are one of the largest sources of capital for small and medium businesses in Uganda. But with the limitations that come with the remote handling of these **SACCOs**, they are not as utilized as they should be. Monitoring the book records has been a hard task to do and for most of these **SACCOs** this is usually done by 2 to 3 members of the group for a period of over six to twelve months and this leads to miscalculations and a lot of Human error.

The traditional methods of savings and loan management (use of pens, and manual files to capture and manage such records) that are used at most finance services in Uganda pose difficulties in capturing, storing, retrieving, and backing up members' records. Since these records are kept in paper files and then stacked, retrieving a particular record is tiresome and time-consuming and there are no security measures to the members' records.


## Our Solution (YSAVE)

We have a solution of building out a simple yet effective mobile application that will make it easy to carry out the day-to-day activities of a **SACCO**, automating the different tasks for example the calculation of the members total contribution and the eligibility of a member for a loan.

With the mobile app, Members will also be able to make some of the utility payments using the mobile app with an offer to borrow for utilities payment.
The **SACCO** mobile app will automate the sacco activites while eliminating the need for physical gather.
